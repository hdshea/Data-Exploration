# Data-Exploration

This repository is intended to host some data exploration of interesting data collected and provided by the [_Our World In Data_](https://ourworldindata.org) organization.

## Life Expectancy and Survival Rates through Time

In __life-expectancy.Rmd__, I explore the life expectancy and survival rate statistics provided in [_this portion_](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy) of the site.  See [__life-expectancy.md__](https://github.com/hdshea/Data-Exploration/blob/master/life-expectancy.md).

In __causes-of-death.Rmd__, I explore the global causes of death statistics provided in [_this portion_](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death) of the site.  See [__causes-of-death.md__](https://github.com/hdshea/Data-Exploration/blob/master/causes-of-death.md).
